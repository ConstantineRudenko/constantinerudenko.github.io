## Timeline

During my study for the bachelor's degree at [KPI](https://kpi.ua/en/fpm), I have worked as a contractor for [RISA Tech, Inc.](https://risa.com/) for 1 year, after which I enrolled for the master's course and dedicated all my efforts towards the university for the time being. My work at Risa Tech mostly concerned a "bridge" between the old C++ code and the new GUI written in C# and WPF. I also worked on developing interactive printable calculation reports using [Telerik Reporting](https://www.telerik.com/products/reporting.aspx).

During the same time, I have taught myself [Unity](https://unity.com/) engine as a hobby, which ended up being used in both my bachelor's ([ProTeGe v2](/#protege-v2)) and master' ([DQ skinning for Unity](/#dq-skinning-for-unity)) theses.

While studying for the master's degree, I got interested in deepening my knowledge of compute shaders, and so proposed to my supervisor a thesis topic which would allow me to indulge this curiosity. The goal was to improve an [existing](https://www.gamedevs.org/uploads/skinning-with-dual-quaternions.pdf) method of skeletal animation by reducing some of the unwanted deformations it introduced ([learn more](https://github.com/KosRud/DQ-skinning-for-Unity#bulging-compensation-method)).

After acquiring the master's degree, I enrolled in a PhD. course at [FIIT STU](https://studuj.fiit.sk/en/) (Slovakia), studying remotely for one year before physically moving to Bratislava. Following my passion for computer graphics, I worked on a research connected to real-time mixed reality systems under the guidance of [Peter Kapec](https://is.stuba.sk/lide/clovek.pl?id=10235) and [Vanda Benešová](https://is.stuba.sk/lide/clovek.pl?id=63121). The project [Material clustering benchmark](/#material-clustering-benchmark) was one of the stepping stones towards the dream of building a real-time mixed reality system which could match the quality of existing alternatives while being fully contained within a headset and require no advance knowledge of the environment. 

Apart from the research, I was tasked with conducting seminars for the bachelor students about web development, which included making a website and a javascript game with [canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). These seminars are the reason *"For students"* section exists on this website, as after teaching the same course to several groups I, noticed the same questions coming up repeatedly and opted to provide a sort of FAQ section with common topics presented in a concise and accessible manner.

As for my thesis, before its ambitious goal could be achieved, the circumstances dictated that I interrupt the study for the time being and focus on a career. Looking at the job offers in Slovakia, it was my impression that web development was the most fruitful area to search for clients, so I ventured to polish my frontend skills (and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) in particular) by creating this very website.
