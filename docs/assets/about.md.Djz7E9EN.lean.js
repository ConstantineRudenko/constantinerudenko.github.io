My work at Risa Tech mostly concerned a &quot;bridge&quot; between the old C++ code and the new GUI written in C# and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/overview/?view=netdesktop-8.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">WPF</a>. I also worked on developing interactive printable calculation reports using <a href="https://www.telerik.com/products/reporting.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Telerik Reporting</a>.</p><p>During the same time, I have taught myself <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Unity</a> engine as a hobby, which ended up being used in both my bachelor&#39;s (<a href="/#protege-v2">ProTeGe v2</a>) and master&#39; (<a href="/#dq-skinning-for-unity">DQ skinning for Unity</a>) theses.</p><p>While studying for the master&#39;s degree, I got interested in deepening my knowledge of compute shaders, and so proposed to my supervisor a thesis topic which would allow me to indulge this curiosity. The goal was to improve an <a href="https://www.gamedevs.org/uploads/skinning-with-dual-quaternions.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">existing</a> method of skeletal animation by reducing some of the unwanted deformations it created (<a href="https://github.com/KosRud/DQ-skinning-for-Unity#bulging-compensation-method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">implementation</a>, <a href="http://journals.khnu.km.ua/vestnik/pdf/tech/pdfbase/2020/2020_1/1-2020_(281).pdf#page=12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">paper</a>).</p><p>After acquiring master&#39;s degree, I enrolled in a PhD. course at <a href="https://studuj.fiit.sk/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FIIT STU</a> (Slovakia). Following my passion for computer graphics, I worked on a research connected to real-time mixed reality systems under the guidance of Prof. Ing. <a href="https://is.stuba.sk/lide/clovek.pl?id=63121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vanda Benešová</a> and Dr. <a href="https://is.stuba.sk/lide/clovek.pl?id=10235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Peter Kapec</a>. The project <a href="/#material-clustering-benchmark">Material clustering benchmark</a> was one of the stepping stones towards the dream of building a real-time mixed reality system which could match the quality of existing alternatives while being fully contained within a headset and require no advance knowledge of the environment.</p><p>Apart from the research, I was tasked with conducting seminars for the bachelor students about web development, which included making a website and a javascript game with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">canvas</a>. These seminars are the reason <em>&quot;For students&quot;</em> section exists on the website, as after teaching the same course to several groups I noticed the same questions coming up repeatedly and opted to provide a sort of FAQ page with common topics presented in a concise and accessible manner.</p><p>As for my thesis, the circumstances dictated that I pause my research before its ambitious goal could be achieved and focus on a career for the foreseeable future. Looking at the job offers in Slovakia, it was my impression that web development is the most fruitful area to search for clients so I ventured to polish my frontend skills (and <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vue.js</a> in particular) by creating this very website.</p>',14)]))}const u=t(n,[["render",i]]);export{f as __pageData,u as default};
