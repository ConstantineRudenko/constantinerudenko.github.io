# Tools

This page lists some tools you can use when developing the website for the course *"základné metódy tvorby multimediálneho obsahu"*.

## Validators

Validators check your HTML and CSS files for errors. The browser will often attempt to make sense of the code, that contains mistakes, and guess the intention behind it. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. This behavior is unpredictable between different browsers and can result in the page being completely broken in one browser, while appearing perfectly functional in the other.

### HTML

* [validator.w3.org](https://validator.w3.org/)

### CSS

* [jigsaw.w3.org](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## Code editor

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

!!! warning
	You can use any code editor of your choice, with the exception of [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) html editors. Using WYSIWYG editors is strictly forbidden.

### VS Code extensions

will be added...

## Wireframe

* [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com)

## Color palette

* [Paletton](https://paletton.com)
* [Colourcode](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colourcode)

## Beautifier / Minifier

* [Beautifytools](https://beautifytools.com/)

Minifier
:	Minifier compresses your code by removing line breaks and whitespaces. This way it will take up less pages in the report.

Beautifier
:	Beautifier makes the code more readable by adding line breaks and whitespaces whenever appropriate. It effectively "reverses" minification.

!!! note
	Neither the minifier, nor the beautifier, should affect the way your web page looks in the browser. It only changes how the **code** looks.
